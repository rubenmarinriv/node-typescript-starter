# Node TypeScript Starter

This project is designed to jumpstart your Node.js development with TypeScript. It comes pre-configured with essential tools and scripts to make your development process smoother.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get your project up and running on your local machine for development and experimentation.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

To set up your development environment, run the following command in the project root directory:

```bash
npm install
```

## Available Scripts
The project includes a set of predefined scripts in package.json for common tasks:

### Build

To compile TypeScript files to JavaScript, run:

```bash
npm run build
```
This script uses the TypeScript compiler to generate JavaScript files in the build directory.

### Development

For development purposes, especially when you need to see changes in real-time, use:

```bash
npm run dev
```
This script watches for changes in your TypeScript files and compiles them automatically, enabling a faster development cycle.

### Start

To build your project and run the resulting JavaScript, execute:

```bash
npm start
```
This command is a combination of building and then executing the Node.js application.
